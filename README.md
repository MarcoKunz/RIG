RIG
===
An aesthetically unopinionated CSS Framework by Codeship

![Codeship BuildStatus](https://codeship.com/projects/a62fd230-b042-0132-a853-0e5ba92aabbb/status?branch=master)

## Requirements for running

If you want to give it a try and checkout everything this framework has to offer, you can let it run easily on your system with `gulp` and `browsersync`.
The `package.json` has you covered with all you need regarding gulp. There are only 2 extra requirements.

As this Build uses `scsslint` for guaranteeing clean scss, you have to install `ruby` and run `gem install scss-lint`.

When you have gulp installed globally, you can kick off the thing by typing `gulp` in your terminal and you are good to go. Browsersync and Notification Builds handle the rest.


## Building

If you want to build the `rig.css` file on your own with your preferences, you can do so easily as this version of rig now supports gulp.

For installing all the dependencies, be sure to have the latest version of `npm` installed on your system. Then, using the Terminal, go to the root folder of this project and type:

```
$ npm install
```

Once everything is installed, go ahead and run gulp from the command line.

```
$ gulp
```

This will build all sass files and output all files in a folder named `dev` by default.
